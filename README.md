This is a plugin to [Cpp2IL](https://github.com/SamboyCoding/Cpp2IL).

Just compile latest Cpp2Il, compile this shitty plugin and copy "Cpp2IL.Plugin.BetterAssemblyOutput.dll" to "yourCompiledCpp2ILBinaries/Plugins/"

And run `.\Cpp2IL.exe --output-as shitty_il --game-path "path to your silly game"`

Get some shitty il with it shitty plugin and see shit in dnspy (or ilspy). If you want to understand something, use dnSpy. IlSpy generates a lot of Unsafe stuff where it shouldn't be. It takes up a lot of screen space!!!

I don't know why I made it. Ignore it.

The best my shitty plugin can produce:
